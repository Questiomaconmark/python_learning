# This is a comment shown by the #, it is ignored by the interpreter (is not apart of program just text)
# means this is just for people reading code including yourself (supposed to explain what stuff is doing in your comments)
# I will be using them so you don't have to hear my stupid voice

# print('Hi Madison')

# think you knew that one

# progamming obviously can do math as well with predefined operators (+ - / *)
# also can do exponents via '**'

# print(2+2)
# print(4*4)
# print(5-3)
# print(int(3/4))
# print(2**3)

# and normally an extra one you don't normally use in regular math (suprisingly useful) the modulo operator %

# print(2%2)
# print(3%2)
# print(4%2)
# print(5%3)

# variables are also a thing

# x = 2
# print(x)
# a = x
# print(x)
# print(a)

# briefest note possible, advanced ish but just good to know
#   python is dynamically typed and strongly typed. This means you dont have to declare the data type when making a new variable, (int x =1)
#   and also that python will not change the type in unexpected ways. some ways are expected. On line 11 I have to convert it back to an int
#   explicitly because / returns a float value (floating decimal). another option would be another operator '//' called the floor division operator
#   which "floors" the result or rounds down
# print(16//4)

# you made it, last concept. Strings! which are regular sentences words or characters (called strings because they are just strings of characters)
# Python uses double and single quotes. Python style guide recommends single quotes so you see it most often

# print('Hi Madison!' + ' Cool beans')

# strings can be added together
# variables also are not just mathematical variables, they can be any data type

# x = 'hi indy'
# y = 'its me Margeret'
# print(x + ' ' +  y)

# different methods of doing the same thing. concatenation (adding strings) for example
# print(f"{x} {y}") #this method is called string interpolation
# list = [x, y]; 
# print(" ".join(list)) #this is done by putting it in an array (python calls them lists) and then joining the array with an empty space a separator
