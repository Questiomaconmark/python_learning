# function review. Purpose to make a block of code reusable
# has parameters that you pass in inside, ()
# has localized scope meaning variables are not visible or usable outside of the function, and vice versa
# barring special circumstances like global scope declaration

# loops! while, for loop (for x = 0; x <10; x++)
# counter = 0
# while True:
#     print(counter)

# lists are very similar to arrays in other languages, but they can have different data types in it
# lists = 0, 1, 2, 3
# list = ["hello", "goodbye", "whats up"]
# print(list)
# print(list[0])
# for x in range(0,3):
#    list[x] = "h"
#
# print(list)

# for x = 0; x <10; x = x+1
# range(1..10)
# for x in range(1,10):
    # print(x)
