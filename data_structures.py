# brief overview of data structures.
# Python has 3 main ones built in, lists, dictionarys and tuples.
# Data structures are just ways to organize data and link it together.
my_list = [2, 5, 3, "hello"]
print(my_list)
# we access data within the structures in different ways determined by which data type it is. Lists use [] and an index number
# STARTING FROM 0 (0 is the first index number in the list)
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[1])
print(my_list)
my_list[0] = 10
print(my_list)
